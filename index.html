            <p>The laws related to the landlord-tenant relationship in New York State are complex. This site will help you navigate those laws. It covers the laws related to creating a landlord-tenant relationship, like when you are looking to rent an apartment and the agreement you will reach once you do so. It also covers the rules that protect tenants once they are in an apartment, like the duties the landlord owes the tenant to keep the apartment or home that is rented in good repair. Finally, it will cover the laws related to ending a landlord-tenant relationship and the eviction process. You will also find useful links that can help you find a lawyer and give you more information about the laws addressed on this site as well as the government agencies that can help tenants who are having problems with their landlords. While a site such as this is no substitute for legal assistance, we hope that you will use the information available here to assist you in navigating the landlord-tenant relationship.</p>
